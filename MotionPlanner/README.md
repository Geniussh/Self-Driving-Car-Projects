## Occupancy Grid Generator
I generated an occupancy grid using lidar measurements from a moving vehicle in an unknown environment. I developed the inverse scanner measurement model to map these measurements into occupancy probabilities, and then perform iterative logodds updates to an occupancy grid belief map. 

## Mission Planner
I implemented Dijkstra's and A* search algorithms on a road network in Berkeley, California. I used OSMNX library to generate Open Street Map data. I also used NetworkX library to generate the correct shortest path as a reference.
