    Keys of the dictionary are items to be put into the queue, and values
    are their respective priorities. All dictionary methods work as expected.
    The advantage over a standard heapq-based priority queue is
    that priorities of items can be efficiently updated (amortized O(1))
    using code as 'thedict[item] = new_priority.'

    The 'smallest' method can be used to return the object with lowest
    priority, and 'pop_smallest' also removes it.

    The 'sorted_iter' method provides a destructive sorted iterator.
